			Chapter 2: The&nbsp;User&nbsp;Interface
		</h3>

		<article>
		
			<h4>
				Goals
			</h4>

			<p>
				This chapter introduces the user interface and provides guidance on how to create 
				a simple network using Packet Tracer.
			</p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h4>
				Getting Started with Packet Tracer
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Packet Tracer is a tool that allows you to simulate real networks. 
				It provides three main menus that allow you to:
			<ul>
				<li>add devices and connect them via cables or wireless</li>
				<li>select, delete, inspect, label, and group components within your network </li>
				<li>manage your network</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The network management menu allows you to:
			<ul>
				<li>open an existing/sample network</li>
				<li>save your current network</li>
				<li>modify your user profile or your preferences</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				For additional help and practice using Packet Tracer, please visit the Tutorials located 
				under Help in the Packet Tracer program. To view some examples of how Packet Tracer 
				can be used, select File, then Open Samples from the main menu.
			</p>
				If you have used any program such as a word processor or spreadsheet, you are already familiar 
				with the File menu commands located in the top menu bar. The Open, Save, Save As, and Exit commands 
				work as they would for any program, but there are two commands that are special to Packet Tracer. 
			<p>
				The Open Samples command will display a directory of prebuilt examples of features and 
				configurations of various network and Internet of Things devices included within Packet Tracer.
			</p>
				The Exit and Logout command will remove the registration information for this copy of Packet Tracer 
				and require the next user of this copy of Packet Tracer to do the login procedure again.

			<h4>
				Finding and Deploying Devices
			</h4>

			<p>
				Since Packet Tracer simulates networks and network traffic, the physical aspects of these networks 
				also needs to be simulated. This includes actually finding and deploying physical devices, 
				customizing those devices, and cabling those devices. After the physical deployment and cabling is done, 
				then it is time for configuration of the interfaces used to connect the devices. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Finding a device to deploy requires looking in the Device-Type Selection Box. 
				The Device-Type Selection Box works on the concept of categories and sub-categories as shown in the figure.
			</p>

			<p>
				The top row of icons represents the category list consisting of: 
				[Networking Devices], [End Devices], [Components], [Connections], 
				[Miscellaneous], and [Multiuser]. 
				Each category contains at least one sub-category group.

			<h4>
				Device Configuration
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Once your network has been created, it is time to configure the devices and components. 
				Packet Tracer has the capability to configure the different intermediate and end devices 
				that make up your network. To access the configuration interface of any devices first click 
				on the device that you wish to configure. A popup window will appear displaying a series of tabs. 
				Different types of devices have different interfaces.

		<article>
			<h4>
				GUI and CLI Configuration
			</h4>

			<p>
				For intermediate devices such as routers and switches, there are two methods 
				of configuration available. Devices can be configured or investigated 
				via a Config tab (a GUI interface) or a command line interface (CLI) (Figure 1). 
				<img src="canvas2114-1.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
				The Config tab does not exist in most physical equipment. 
				This tab is a learning tab in Packet Tracer. 
				If you don’t know how to use the command line interface, this tab provides a way 
				to “fill in the blank” to do basic configurations. 
				It will show the equivalent CLI commands that would do the same thing if using 
				the Command Line Interface. The CLI interface requires knowledge of device configuration.
			</p>

			<p>
				For some of the end devices, such as PCs and laptops, Packet Tracer provides a 
				desktop interface that gives you access to IP configuration, wireless configuration, 
				a command prompt, a Web browser, and much more (Figure 2).
				<img src="canvas2114-2.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are configuring a server, the server has all of the functions of the Host 
				with the addition of one more tab, the services tab (Figure 3). 
				<img src="canvas2114-3.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
				This tab allows a server to be configured as a web server, a DHCP server, 
				a DNS server, or various other servers visible in the graphic.

			Chapter 3: Simulation&nbsp;Mode
		</h3>

		<article>
			<h4>
				Goals
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				In this chapter, you learn how to use Packet Tracer’s powerful simulation mode. 
				This mode allows you to verify device connectivity and to study 
				how the various types of data traverse your network
			</p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h4>
				Creating PDUs in Simulation Mode
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Packet Tracer provides a Simulation mode that allows you to create and 
				capture PDUs to check several functions within your network, such as:
			</p>

			<ul><li>
					Basic Connectivity – Can all devices communicate with each other?
				</li><li>
					Security – Are access lists functioning as designed?
				</li><li>
					Applications and Services – Are applications and 
					services such as DNS, HTTP, and FTP functioning as designed?
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The default mode for Packet Tracer is Realtime mode. 
				In Realtime mode the time is continuously running as indicated by the clock 
				in the lower right hand corner of the worksheet. In Simulation mode, 
				time can be stopped or slowed to allow users to view data traffic one packet at a time. 
				Simulation mode is used to observe network traffic in detail with time controlled directly by the user.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Play the video to see how to use Simulation mode to create simple PDUs to replicate ICMP and 
				ARP functionality and how to create more complex PDUs from a list of protocols 
				such as DNS, HTTP, Telnet, SSH, FTP, and many more.

			<h4>
				Viewing the Contents of PDUs
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Once the PDUs have been captured, you have several ways to view their contents. 
				Viewing the contents of the PDUs can be used to verify connectivity, verify functionality, 
				and troubleshoot issues. It is also a great tool for studying or 
				reviewing the contents of the OSI model layers and the mechanisms of communication.
			</p>

			<p>
				If viewed in OSI Model mode, you see a summary of the addresses and 
				contents of the headers at each layer. If you select Inbound or Outbound PDU Details, 
				the exact format of the appropriate headers is displayed.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Play the video to see how to view PDUs.

			Chapter 4: Packet&nbsp;Tracer Physical&nbsp;View and File&nbsp;Assessment&nbsp;Types
		</h3>

		<article>
			<h4>
				Goals
			</h4>

			<p>
				In this chapter, you are introduced to the Physical view. 
				This mode allows you to place a logical network topology into a physical context. 
				Packet Tracer creates various file types. 
				The file types are introduced in this chapter and we also discuss how Packet Tracer 
				is used as an assessment tool.
			</p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h4>
				The Packet Tracer Physical View
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Now that you know the purpose and the use of the menus in the logical workspace, 
				we will move on to learn about the physical workspace in Packet Tracer. 
				The default view for Packet Tracer is Logical, 
				which is equivalent to creating a logical diagram for the network. 
				The other type of diagram used in networking is the physical diagram 
				which not only shows the relationships of the network devices 
				but also applies building and distance factors in making the design. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Packet Tracer has the physical workspace that allows you to make 
				your network more realistic by adding backgrounds, buildings, and wiring closets. 
				These features are important for documentation, design, and visualization. 
				You can see the actual layout of the network within a room or a building. 
				This provides valuable information into the flow of traffic and the suitability 
				and placement of equipment. 
				The Physical view also has a great feature that shows the wireless coverage areas 
				based on your equipment placement within buildings.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this section, you will learn to:
				<ul>
					<li>Navigate the physical workspace.</li>
					<li>Add cities, corporate offices, and branch offices.</li>
					<li>Add backgrounds into the cities and offices.</li>
					<li>Add wiring closets to the offices.</li>
					<li>Place networking devices into racks within the closets.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When the Physical view is shown, the basic organizational scheme is the following:
				<ol type="a">
					<li>intercity</li>
					<li>city</li>
					<li>building</li>
					<li>wiring closet</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A user is able to add as many cities, buildings, and wiring closets as they need; 
				however, there can only be one intercity. Containers of smaller sizes can be added 
				at any level but larger containers cannot be added into smaller containers. 
				For example, a building can be added to the intercity, 
				but a city cannot be added to a building, 
				and a building cannot be added to a wiring closet. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Play the video to learn how to use the features of the physical workspace.

			<h4>
				Packet Tracer File Types
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Packet Tracer has the ability to create three different types of files. 
				These file types are used for different purposes and include: 
				.pkt, .pkz, and .pka. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The .pkt file type is used when a simulated network is built in Packet Tracer and saved. 
				The .pkt file can also have backgrounds embedded within it. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The .pkz file type is not used very often. 
				It is a compressed file that allows the inclusion of other files, 
				such as .pdf files, along with the Packet Tracer files.
			</p>

			<p>
				The .pka file type is a Packet Tracer Activity file. 
				This file type contains a Packet Tracer activity plus an instruction window. 
				The instructions provide a walkthrough of the necessary processes 
				required to complete the activity, assignment, or assessment. 
				The instruction window also contains a completion percentage to track 
				how much of the activity has been successfully completed. 
				There is also a Check Results feature that can be configured to provide feedback.
			</p>

			<p>
				Play the video to see the differences and uses of each of the three file types.

				Packet Tracer Assessment Types
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Packet Tracer is used in the Networking Academy to assist in the design, 
				creation and testing of networks and network applications. 
				Packet Tracer is also used for purposes of self-evaluation, practice, and formal assessment. 
				This section will display and discuss PTSAs and PTMOs. 
			</p>

			<p>
				A PTMO (Packet Tracer as a Media Object) is an assessment item 
				where a Packet Tracer Activity is part of the assessment item. 
				Once the .pka is loaded, the student is provided with a small set of instructions to be completed. 
				Once completed, they are able to return to the item to answer the question based on their work. 
				PTMOs can be used by themselves or as an item on a quiz or final exam.
			</p>

			<p>
				A PTSA (Packet Tracer Skills Assessment) is used as a standalone skills-based assessment complete 
				with a full set of instructions. Students are required to build, modify, and/or troubleshoot a network. 
				PTSAs are often done in a timed environment. 
				Once the student has completed the activity, they submit their work to netacad.com. 
				Some PTSAs are configured to allow students to save their work and continue at a later time.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Once a PTSA has been completed, the student will receive their score plus item level feedback. 
				They also see a list of objectives of the PTSA along with information about what they did right and what they did wrong. 
				All forms of feedback are intended to assist the student to improve their skills.

			Chapter 5: IoT&nbsp;Components in Packet&nbsp;Tracer
		</h3>

		<article>
			<h4>
				Goals
			</h4>

			<p>
				In simple terms the IoT is a connection of networked sensors, actuators, and smart devices that collect and share data.  
				Packet Tracer 7 contains many new features to support the IoT. 
				This includes the addition of IoT devices that can be configured to react to certain environmental values 
				such as sun, wind, rain, and humidity. 
				These devices can be configured to take actions based on the changing environmental values, 
				such as turning on lights or closing garage doors. The next few chapters include instructions to locate the IoT devices, 
				to connect them to your network, 
				to configure and modify scripts to make them function, and to control these devices remotely. 
				Packet Tracer provides everything you need to create simulated smart homes, smart cities, and smart factories.
			</p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h4>
				Configure IoT Devices using Packet Tracer.
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Packet Tracer has a wide variety of sensors and smart devices that will allow you to design smart homes, 
				smart cities, smart factories, and smart power grids. 
			</p>

			<p>
				To locate the available sensors and smart devices, select End Devices from the Device Selection box 
				at the lower left-hand side of the screen. 
				Next select one of the subcategories such as Home.

			<h4>
				Registering Devices to a Dedicated Registration Server.
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				IoT devices can also be registered to a dedicated Registration Server 
				for remote monitoring, configuration, or programming. 
				The dedicated registration server has the benefit of being able 
				to provide many other services to your network, 
				such as Web, DHCP, DNS, email, and FTP. 
			</p>

			<p>
				With a dedicated server, IoT devices would first be connected to a wireless network 
				and would then be configured to register to the server.
			</p>

			<p>
				To connect and configure the registration server:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Connect the server to your network using a wired or wireless connection.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click on the server and select Desktop/IP configuration. 
						Ensure that DHCP has been turned on and then verify that 
						the server is obtaining an IP addresse.
					</li>
					<li>
						Select Services/IoT and turn the Registration Server on.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To configure a remote device to interact with the registration server: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						Connect a remote device such as a tablet, PC, 
						or smart phone to the wireless network.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click on the remote device and select Desktop/Web Browser. 
						Use the IP address of the registration server as the URL.
					</li>
					<li>
						The first time you access the server, you will have to create a user login. 
						Subsequent visits will require you to login using the login credentials. For security reasons, 
						it is important to protect your IoT devices by using strong passwords on your server.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To register IoT devices with the Dedicated Server:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Click on each device and select the Config tab.
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the remote server option under IoT server and supply the IP address of the server, plus the login information.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use the remote device to verify the presence of the registered IoT devices.
					</li>
				</ul>

			Chapter 7: Packet&nbsp;Tracer Environment&nbsp;Controls
		</h3>

		<article>
			<h4>
				Goals
			</h4>

			<p>
				In this chapter, you will learn: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						The environmental controls that are available in Packet Tracer.
					</li>
					<li>
						How to configure environmental controls within containers.
					</li>
					<li>
						How smart devices interact with the Packet Tracer environmental elements.

			<h4>
				Environmental Controls available in Packet Tracer.
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				In the Physical Workspace there are containers. 
				Each container, the intercity, city, buildings, and wiring closets, 
				all have their own set of environmental values. 
				There are 24 default environmental elements, 
				such as temperature, rain, water level, wind speed, and snow. 
				Many devices or Things affect or respond to the environment in some way. 
				A Fire Sprinkler will raise the water level and humidity in a container. 
				An old car will increase various gases and ambient temperature when turned on. 
				A smoke detector can be used to trigger an alarm when the smoke in environment increases to a certain point.
			</p>

			<p>
				If there are no devices configured to affect the environment, 
				their values are looped on a 24-hour cycle. 
				For example, the sun will come up at 6am and set at 6pm. 
				The ambient temperature will peak at 25°C at noon. 
				This cycle is set on the intercity level and its ambient temperature range 
				will propagate all the way down to the main wiring closet automatically. 
				If a heater is added to the Corporate Office and turned on, 
				the temperature inside the Corporate Office will increase along with all the containers within it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note however, the heater does not heat up the parent container, 
				Home City, it will only heat up the child containers. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When the heater is turned off, the Corporate Office will eventually converge 
				to the parent container's ambient temperature, Home City, 
				based on its transference value. 
				Different containers may have different levels of insulation and thus different transference values; 
				the transference values determine the rate that the child container converges 
				with the parent container and works the same way for all environment types.
			</p>

			<p>
				Play the video to see the environmental elements available, how they work and how to modify them.

			<p>
				Important terms and concepts:		
				<ul>
					<li>
						Current time – time inside a container that increments by 30 minute increments. 
						Every 1 second in real time equates to 30 minutes in “Container” time. 
						The timer goes from 0 (midnight) to 11:59. (Figure 1)
						<img src="canvas7121-1.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
					</li>
					<li>
						KeyFrame – represents a single moment in time
					</li>
					<li>
						KeyFrame graph – A graph that shows the value of environmental elements 
						at any given point in time throughout the day. (Figure 2)
						<img src="canvas7121-2.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
					</li>
					<li>
						Transference - values that determine the rate that the child container 
						converges with the parent container and works the same way for all environment types. 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		

			<p>
				To modify environmental elements within a container:
				<ol type="1">
					<li>
						Select Environmental from the top right hand corner of the Physical view. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the appropriate container location.

			Chapter 8: Creating&nbsp;and&nbsp;Programming Objects in&nbsp;Packet&nbsp;Tracer
		</h3>

		<article>
			<h4>
				Goals
			</h4>

			<p>
				In this chapter, you will learn:
				<ul>
					<li>How to create a new Thing.</li>
					<li>How to connect your new Thing to the network.</li>
					<li>How to use available scripts for the new Thing.</li>
					<li>How to access the programming environment.</li>
					<li>How to review and modify existing scripts.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</article>
		
		<article>
			<h4>
				Creating and Connecting a Thing.
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Before attempting to create a new Thing, you need to decide what the Thing will do, 
				how it will connect to the network, and how it will work. 
				You need to find graphics to represent the states of your new Thing. 
				Usually you will need two graphics, one to represent the beginning or default state 
				and another to represent the end state. You also need to identify 
				an existing Thing that functions in a similar manner as the new Thing. 
				The existing script can then be modified to create the new script.
			</p>

			<p>
				Clicking on any IoT device that is in the workspace will reveal 
				the specifications about that device. The specifications include: 
				<ul>
					<li>
						Features – how the device works or what it does. Devices can generate 
						high and low values based on a button being pushed or toggled 
						on and off or they can detect certain environmental values (eg. Smoke or sunlight)
					</li>
					<li>
						 Usage – Things may connect to other IoT devices in order to receive 
						 LOW or HIGH inputs or it may read the variable set in the Environment object
					</li>
					<li>
						Direct Control – shows you what keystrokes will allow you to physically interact with the Thing 
					</li>
					<li>
						Local and Remote Control – shows how to control the Thing locally or remotely (if applicable)
					</li>
					<li>
						Data Specifications – how the values are produced or the port/slot used to connect to the sensor
					</li>
					<li>
						Example – Describes an example of how it works
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				To create the new Thing:
				<ol type="1">
					<li>
						Click the Advanced tab/Thing Editor from within the existing object specifications page. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Associate the new graphics to their respective states by clicking on a state 
						and browsing to the location of the graphic on your local device. 
						The images will be saved automatically.
					</li>
					<li>
						 Click on the Config tab to select the network adaptor to be used to connect to the network (if applicable).
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				To save the new Thing:
				<ol type="1">
					<li>
						Select Tools/Custom Device Dialog from the uppermost toolbar.
					</li>
					<li>
						Within the Device Template Manager.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						Click on Select and click on the Thing to be saved. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Modify the template and description as appropriate.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click on the type of new Thing.
					</li>
					<li>
						Click on Add – the new template will be saved in the PT template file 
						on the local disk and the customized Thing will now display with the other sensors.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
				
			<p>
				NOTE: This local version of Packet Tracer, with the new Thing, can be sent to another user as long as the user also has the new template on their local disk.
			</p>

			<h4>
				The Programming Environment.
			</h4>

			<p>
				To be able to provide true IoT solutions, 
				it is critical to have programming knowledge. 
				Packet Tracer provides support for JavaScript, Python, and Visual Blocky. 	
			</p>

			<p>
				To enter the programming environment.
				<ol type="1">
					<li>
						 Open an IoT device and click on the Advanced button.
					</li>
					<li>
						Select the Programming tab.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Once in the Programming area, you can program a new script 
				or copy an existing script from another Thing.
			</p>

			<p>
				To modify environmental elements within a container:
				<ol type=""1>
					<li>
						Select the script in the panel to the left and select Open. (Figure 1)
						<img src="canvas8121-1.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
					</li>
					<li>
						The selected programming script will appear in the right hand panel and may be edited as appropriate. 
						You can use the editing buttons (Figure 2) to make the script modification easier.
						<img src="canvas8121-2.png" width="auto" height="auto" />
					</li>
					<li>
						Once finished any required modifications, simply close the Programming tab and the changes will be saved.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				It is also possible to completely delete the old script and program your Thing from scratch.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h4>
				Reviewing and Modifying Scripts.
			</h4>
		
			<p>
				Packet Tracer provides a large number of devices that can be modified to create new Things. 
				It is often easier to modify an existing object that has similar functionality to the Thing 
				being created than it is to program an entirely new Thing.
			</p>
