                    Hi, my name is Guru. Welcome to eLearning company @Apollo. We’re delighted to have you on board. The
                    company is in a critical growth phase, but we’re worried that we’re susceptible to security
                    breaches.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We’ve seen so many companies fall victim to cybercrime, and we don’t want to be next. We need to
                    move quickly and build our cybersecurity defenses. Are you ready to help?

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from
                    digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.

                        At an organizational level, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the organization’s
                        reputation, data and customers.

                        As more digital information is being gathered and shared, its protection becomes even more vital
                        at the government level, where national security, economic stability and the safety and
                        wellbeing of citizens are at stake.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you, and it can exist both
                    <b>offline</b> and <b>online</b>.

                    <p>
                        Your offline identity is the real-life persona that you present on a daily basis at home, at
                        school or at work. As a result, family and friends know details about your personal life,
                        including your full name, age and address.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important not to overlook the importance of securing your offline identity. Identity
                        thieves can easily steal your data from right under your nose when you’re not looking!

                    <p>
                        Your online identity is not just a name. It’s who you are and how you present yourself to others
                        online. It includes the username or alias you use for your online accounts, as well as the
                        social identity you establish and portray on online communities and websites. </p>
                    <p>
                        You should take care to limit the amount of personal information you reveal through your online
                        identity.

                    Many people think that if they don’t have any social media or online accounts set up, then they
                    don’t have an online identity. This is not the case. If you use the web, you have an online
                    identity.

                    <p>
                        When choosing a username, it’s important not to reveal any personal information. It should be
                        something appropriate and respectful and should not lead strangers to think you are an easy
                        target for cybercrimes or unwanted attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some other useful tips to help you generate your username:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t use your email username.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to
                            track.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of
                            numbers/letters or the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or
                            the department in which you work, such as IT.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or
                            personal.
                        </li>

                            Every time you visit the doctor, personal information regarding your physical and mental
                            health and wellbeing is added to your electronic health records (EHRs). Since the majority
                            of these records are saved online, you need to be aware of the medical information that you
                            share.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And these records go beyond the bounds of the doctor’s office. For example, many fitness
                            trackers collect large amounts of clinical data such as your heart rate, blood pressure and
                            blood sugar levels, which is transferred, stored and displayed via the cloud. Therefore, you

                    This has got you thinking. Only yesterday, you shared a couple of photos of your first day on the

                <p>
                    Consider how often you use your computing devices to access your personal data. Unless you have
                    chosen to receive paper statements, you probably access digital copies of bank account statements
                    via your bank’s website. And when paying a bill, it’s highly likely that you’ve transferred the
                    required funds via a mobile banking app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But besides allowing you to access your information, computing devices can now also generate
                    information about you.

                    It might seem that information available online is free. But is privacy the price we pay for this
                    digital convenience?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, social media companies generate the majority of their income by selling targeted
                    advertising based on customer data that has been mined using algorithms or formulas. Of course,
                    these companies will argue that they are not ‘selling’ customer data, but ‘sharing’ customer data
                    with their marketing partners.

                    1.1.8 What Do Hackers Want?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    So, with all this information about you available online, what do hackers want? Of course, they want
                    your money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Can you think of an example that you have experienced yourself or that you have heard or read about,
                    where cybercriminals have accessed or tried to access financial information online?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Were you able to think of at least one example?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A cybercriminal can take advantage of your relationships, accessing your online accounts and
                    appealing to your good nature to try and trick you into wiring money to your friends or family in a
                    time of need. For example, there have been many reported cases of hackers impersonating family
                    members and sending messages stating that they need money wired in order to get home from abroad
                    after losing their wallets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And while you may think that your frequent flyer air miles are not valuable to cybercriminals, think
                    again. In 2015, cybercriminals hacked approximately 10,000 American Airlines and United accounts,
                    booking free flights and upgrades using stolen credentials. Even though the frequent flyer miles
                    were returned to the customers by the airlines, this example demonstrates the value of your login
                    credentials.

                    Cybercriminals are certainly very imaginative when it comes to gaining access to your money. But
                    that’s not all they are after — they could also steal your identity and ruin your life.

                            medical procedures carried out in your name will then be saved in your medical records.

                            file a fake tax return and collect the refund. They could even take out loans in your name
                            and ruin your credit rating (and your life as well).
