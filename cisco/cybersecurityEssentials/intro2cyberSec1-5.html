                Cyberwarfare, as its name suggests, is the use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s
                computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a
                power grid.

                    1.5.1 Sign of the Times (Stuxnet)
                </h3>

                <p>
                    One example of a state-sponsored attack involved the Stuxnet malware that was designed not just to
                    hijack targeted computers but to actually cause physical damage to equipment controlled by
                    computers!
                </p>


                <p>
                    You know when it comes to security news, it's always puzzling what gets reported. As viewers of this
                    show, you know there's a very regular rhythm of security issues that are always bubbling just below
                    the surface and it takes something truly profound to grab the public's attention. Well, one new
                    threat making the rounds did have the right mix of ingredients last summer. Stuxnet. I mean it makes
                    sense, right? Computer attacks, nuclear power, foreign governments, sabotage, spy versus spy. But
                    how much of it is real? Enough to say it's a sign of the times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now as all good threats, the details will continue to evolve, but I do think that there are five
                    items worth paying attention to here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first one, non-trivial distribution. Primarily spread via USB sticks. Think non-Internet
                    connected systems that then propagate by escalating privilege levels through zero day exploits,
                    notable for the fact that true zeros are special and they're only valuable for a short period of
                    time. Very expensive, very hard to come by.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next one, sophistication. This is an intelligent worm. Initially targeting Windows computers,
                    where it even installs its own drivers using a stolen but legitimate certificate. The offending
                    certificate gets revoked of course, but then another one gets added within 24 hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our third point, modular coding. This thing can get new tires while still on the road. Multiple
                    control servers. First in Malaysia, then Denmark, now more, including peer-to-peer. In fact, when
                    two run into each other, they compare versions and make sure that they're both updated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fourth point, unique targeting. Windows is just the intermediary, the friend of the friend. Stuxnet
                    is looking for a particular model of PLC. That's programmable logic controller, which is technically
                    not SCADA as it's often reported. These are small imbedded industrial control systems that run all
                    sorts of automated processes, from factories to oil refineries to nuclear power plants. Stuxnet will
                    leverage the vulnerability in the controller software to reach in and change very specific bits of
                    data. Shut things off. Don't grease a bearing for 10 minutes. Don't sound an alarm. This is really
                    unique knowledge. Respectable coding skills that imply a higher level of patience of good funding
                    resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our final point, motive. Stuxnet does not perform... excuse me. It does not threaten. It performs
                    sabotage. Really has no criminal focus. Does not spread indiscriminately or steal credit card
                    information or login credentials. It does not recruit systems into a botnet. It targets
                    infrastructure, our most essential necessities like power, water, safety and much, much more. You
                    know these are older systems. Very established. Generally run with the mentality of hey, if it ain't
                    broke, don't fix it. These things don't get watched over and patched by technical handlers who
                    understand these kind of things. Not yet anyway. So stay tuned. This one is not done. We all have a
                    lot to learn and somebody is working hard to teach us.

                    1.5.2 The Purpose of Cyberwarfare
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they
                    are nations or competitors.
                </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A nation or international organization can engage in cyberwarfare in order to steal defense
                            secrets and gather information about technology that will help narrow the gaps in its
                            industries and military capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, compromised sensitive data can give attackers leverage to blackmail personnel
                            within a foreign government.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides industrial and military espionage, a nation can continuously invade another nation’s
                            infrastructure in order to cause disruption and chaos.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, a cyber attack could shut down the power grid of a major city. Consider the
                            consequences if this were to happen; roads would be congested, the exchange of goods and
                            services would be halted, patients would not be able to get the care they would need if an
                            emergency occurred, access to the internet would be interrupted. By shutting down a power
                            grid, a cyber attack could have a huge impact on the everyday life of ordinary citizens.
                        </p>

            <img src="intro2cybersec.img/guru.png" alt="" title="" width="auto" height="auto" />

            <p>
                Cyberwarfare can destabilize a nation, disrupt its commerce, and cause its citizens to lose faith and
                confidence in their government without the attacker ever physically setting foot in the targeted
                country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cyberwarfare is a very serious issue with potentially devastating consequences, and attacks are becoming
                more widespread. Now, more than ever, nations and governments need cybersecurity professionals to help
                protect their citizens and infrastructure.
