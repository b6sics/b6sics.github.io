                                This is a bit of a grey area and would also depend on local laws. In many cases, if the
                                employee did something with the knowledge or approval of the company, then the legal

                                Phishing, spyware, and social engineering are security attacks that collect network and
                                user information. Adware consists, typically, of annoying popup windows. Unlike a DDoS
                                attack, none of these attacks generate large amounts of data traffic that can restrict
                                access to network services.

                                Nmap allows an administrator to perform port scanning to probe computers and the network
                                for open ports. This helps the administrator verify that network security policies are
                                in place.

                                The Cyber Kill Chain describes the phases of a progressive cyberattack operation. The
                                phases include the following:

                                In general, these phases are carried out in sequence. However, during an attack, several

                                The time between a cyberattack and the time it takes to discover the attack is the time
                                when hackers can get into a network and steal data. An important goal of the CSIRT is to
                                ensure company, system, and data preservation through timely investigations into
                                security incidents.

                                An IDS, or intrusion detection system, is a device that can scan packets and compare
                                them to a set of rules or attack signatures. If the packets match attack signatures,
                                then the IDS can create an alert and log the detection.
