                    2.1.1 Types of Malware
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Cybercriminals use many different types of malicious software, or malware, to carry out their
                    activities. Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause
                    harm to or compromise a system. Knowing what the different types are and how they spread is key to
                    containing and removing them.

                        Designed to track and spy on you, spyware monitors your online activity and can log
                        every key you press on your keyboard, as well as capture almost any of your data,
                        including sensitive personal information such as your online banking details. Spyware
                        does this by modifying the security settings on your devices.

                        hard to ignore when you’re faced with constant pop-up ads on your screen.

                        This type of malware is used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication
                        procedures to access a system. As a result, hackers can gain remote access to resources within
                        an application and issue remote system commands.

                        This malware is designed to hold a computer system or the data it contains captive until a
                        payment is made. Ransomware usually works by encrypting your data so that you can’t access it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some versions of ransomware can take advantage of specific system vulnerabilities to lock it
                        down. Ransomware is often spread through phishing emails that encourage you to download a
                        malicious attachment or through a software vulnerability.

                        This is a type of malware that uses 'scare’ tactics to trick you into taking a specific action.
                        Scareware mainly consists of operating system style windows that pop up to warn you that your
                        system is at risk and needs to run a specific program for it to return to normal operation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you agree to execute the specific program, your system will become infected with malware.
