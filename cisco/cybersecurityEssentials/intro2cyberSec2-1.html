                </h3>

                <p>
                    Cybercriminals use many different types of malicious software, or malware, to carry out their
                    activities. Malware is any code that can be used to steal data, bypass access controls, or cause
                    harm to or compromise a system. Knowing what the different types are and how they spread is key to
                    containing and removing them.

                        Designed to track and spy on you, spyware monitors your online activity and can log
                        every key you press on your keyboard, as well as capture almost any of your data,
                        including sensitive personal information such as your online banking details. Spyware
                        does this by modifying the security settings on your devices.

                    <p>
                        It often bundles itself with legitimate software or Trojan horses.

                        hard to ignore when you’re faced with constant pop-up ads on your screen.

                        This type of malware is used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing the normal authentication
                        procedures to access a system. As a result, hackers can gain remote access to resources within
                        an application and issue remote system commands.

                        This malware is designed to hold a computer system or the data it contains captive until a
                        payment is made. Ransomware usually works by encrypting your data so that you can’t access it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some versions of ransomware can take advantage of specific system vulnerabilities to lock it
                        down. Ransomware is often spread through phishing emails that encourage you to download a
                        malicious attachment or through a software vulnerability.

                        This is a type of malware that uses 'scare’ tactics to trick you into taking a specific action.
                        Scareware mainly consists of operating system style windows that pop up to warn you that your
                        system is at risk and needs to run a specific program for it to return to normal operation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you agree to execute the specific program, your system will become infected with malware.

                        This malware is designed to modify the operating system to create a backdoor, which attackers
                        can then use to access your computer remotely. Most rootkits take advantage of software
                        vulnerabilities to gain access to resources that normally shouldn’t be accessible (privilege
                        escalation) and modify system files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rootkits can also modify system forensics and monitoring tools, making them very hard to detect.
                        In most cases, a computer infected by a rootkit has to be wiped and any required software
                        reinstalled.

                        A virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates and attaches itself to
                        other executable files, such as a document, by inserting its own code. Most viruses require
                        end-user interaction to initiate activation and can be written to act on a specific date or
                        time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Viruses can be relatively harmless, such as those that display a funny image. Or they can be
                        destructive, such as those that modify or delete data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Viruses can also be programmed to mutate in order to avoid detection. Most viruses are spread by
                        USB drives, optical disks, network shares or email.

                        This malware carries out malicious operations by masking its true intent. It might appear
                        legitimate but is, in fact, very dangerous. Trojans exploit your user privileges and are most
                        often found in image files, audio files or games.

                    <p>
                        Unlike viruses, Trojans do not self-replicate but act as a decoy to sneak malicious software
                        past unsuspecting users.

                        This is a type of malware that replicates itself in order to spread from one computer to
                        another. Unlike a virus, which requires a host program to run, worms can run by themselves.
                        Other than the initial infection of the host, they do not require user participation and can
                        spread very quickly over the network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Worms share similar patterns: They exploit system vulnerabilities, they have a way to propagate
                        themselves, and they all contain malicious code (payload) to cause damage to computer systems or
                        networks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Worms are responsible for some of the most devastating attacks on the Internet. In 2001, the
                        Code Red worm had infected over 300,000 servers in just 19 hours.
