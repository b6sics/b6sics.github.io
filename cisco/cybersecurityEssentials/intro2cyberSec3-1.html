                    <p>
                        You should use at least one type of firewall (either a software firewall or a hardware firewall
                        on a router) to protect your device from unauthorized access. The firewall should be turned on
                        and constantly updated to prevent hackers from accessing your personal or organization data.

                        Malicious software, such as viruses and spyware, are designed to gain unauthorized access to
                        your computer and your data. Once installed, viruses can destroy your data and slow down your
                        computer. They can even take over your computer and broadcast spam emails using your account.
                        Spyware can monitor your online activities, collect your personal information or produce
                        unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser while you are online.

                    <p>
                        To prevent this, you should only ever download software from trusted websites. However, you
                        should always use antivirus software to provide another layer of protection. This software,
                        which often includes antispyware, is designed to scan your computer and incoming email for
                        viruses and delete them. Keeping your software up to date will protect your computer from any
                        new malicious software that emerges.

                        computer and browser to medium level or higher. You should also regularly update your computer’s
                        operating system, including your web browser, and download and install the latest software
                        patches and security updates from the vendors.

                IoT devices pose an even greater risk than your other computing devices. While desktop, laptop and
                mobile platforms receive frequent software updates, most IoT devices have their original software. If
                vulnerabilities are found in the software, the IoT device is likely to be vulnerable. And to make the
                problem worse, IoT devices require Internet access, most often relying on your local network. The result
                is that when IoT devices are compromised, they allow hackers access to your local network and data. The
                best way to protect yourself from this scenario is to set up any IoT devices on an isolated network.

                    3.1.3 Wireless Network Security at Home
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Wireless networks allow Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops and tablets, to connect to the
                    network by way of a preset network identifier, known as the service set identifier (SSID). Although
                    a wireless router can be configured so that it doesn’t broadcast the SSID, this should not be
                    considered adequate security for a wireless network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hackers will be aware of the preset SSID and default password. Therefore, these details should be
                    changed to prevent intruders from entering your home wireless network. Furthermore, you should
                    encrypt wireless communication by enabling wireless security and the WPA2 encryption feature on your
                    wireless router. But be aware, even with WPA2 encryption enabled, a wireless network can still be
                    vulnerable.

                            This vulnerability can be exploited by key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs) by intruders. In
                            simple terms, attackers break the encryption between a wireless router and a wireless
                            device, giving them access to network data. This flaw affects all modern, protected Wi-Fi

                </h3>

                <p>
                    When you are away from home, you can access your online information and surf the Internet via public
                    wireless networks or Wi-Fi hotspots. However, there are some risks involved, which mean that it is

                        <p>
                            You should always verify that your device isn’t configured with file and media sharing and
                            that it requires user authentication with encryption.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should also use an encrypted VPN service to prevent others from intercepting your
                            information (known as ‘eavesdropping’) over a public wireless network. This service gives
                            you secure access to the Internet, by encrypting the connection between your device and the
                            VPN server. Even if hackers intercept a data transmission in an encrypted VPN tunnel, they
                            will not be able to decipher it.

            <p>
                Don’t forget that the Bluetooth wireless protocol, found on many smartphones and tablets, can also be
                exploited by hackers to eavesdrop, establish remote access controls, distribute malware and drain
                batteries!
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, my top tip is to keep Bluetooth turned off when you aren’t using it.

                    3.1.5 Password Security
                </h3>

                <p>
                    You’ve logged into your new laptop and it has prompted you to change your network password. You
                    already struggle to remember the few passwords you use for your personal accounts online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You ask one of your colleagues for their advice. They tell you to use one of the passwords you use
                    for your personal accounts — that’s what they do! They keep their personal passwords written down at
                    the back of their diary, just in case they forget them.

                <p>
                    It’s important that all of your online accounts have a unique password. Using the same passwords
                    leaves you and your data vulnerable to cybercriminals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And if it becomes too much to remember all of these passwords, you should use a password manager.
                    This tool stores and encrypts all of your passwords and helps you log into your accounts
                    automatically.

                <p>
                    In order to prevent unauthorized access to your devices, you should consider using passphrases
                    instead of passwords. A passphrase generally takes the form of a sentence (‘Acat th@tlov3sd0gs.’),
                    making it easier for you to remember. And because it’s longer than a typical password, it’s less
                    vulnerable to dictionary or brute-force attacks.

                    3.1.8 Password Guidelines
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published improved
                    password requirements. NIST standards are intended for government applications but can serve as a
                    standard for other sectors as well.

                        <p>
                            These guidelines aim to place responsibility for user verification on service providers and
                            ensure a better experience for users overall. They state:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Passwords should be at least eight characters, but no more than 64 characters.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Common, easily guessed passwords, such as ‘password’ or ‘abc123’ should not be used.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There should be no composition rules, such as having to include lower and uppercase
                                letters and numbers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Users should be able to see the password when typing, to help improve accuracy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                All printing characters and spaces should be allowed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                There should be no password hints.

                            <li>
                                There should be no password expiration period.

                            <li>
                                There should be no knowledge-based authentication, such as having to provide answers to
                                secret questions or verify transaction history.
                            </li>
