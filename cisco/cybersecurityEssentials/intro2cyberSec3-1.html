                <p>
                    Your computing devices are the portal to your online life, storing a lot of your personal data.
                    Therefore, it’s important to protect the security of your devices.

                    <p>
                        You should use at least one type of firewall (either a software firewall or a hardware firewall
                        on a router) to protect your device from unauthorized access. The firewall should be turned on
                        and constantly updated to prevent hackers from accessing your personal or organization data.

                        Malicious software, such as viruses and spyware, are designed to gain unauthorized access to
                        your computer and your data. Once installed, viruses can destroy your data and slow down your
                        computer. They can even take over your computer and broadcast spam emails using your account.
                        Spyware can monitor your online activities, collect your personal information or produce
                        unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser while you are online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To prevent this, you should only ever download software from trusted websites. However, you
                        should always use antivirus software to provide another layer of protection. This software,
                        which often includes antispyware, is designed to scan your computer and incoming email for
                        viruses and delete them. Keeping your software up to date will protect your computer from any
                        new malicious software that emerges.

                        Hackers are always trying to take advantage of vulnerabilities that may exist in your operating
                        system (such as Microsoft Windows or macOS) or web browser (such as Google Chrome or Apple
                        Safari).

                    <p>
                        Therefore, to protect your computer and your data, you should set the security settings on your
                        computer and browser to medium level or higher. You should also regularly update your computer’s
                        operating system, including your web browser, and download and install the latest software
                        patches and security updates from the vendors.

                    <p>
                        All of your computing devices, including PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones, should be
                        password protected to prevent unauthorized access. Any stored information, especially sensitive
                        or confidential data, should be encrypted. You should only store necessary information on your
                        mobile device, in case it is stolen or lost.

                        Remember, if any one of your devices is compromised, the criminals may be able to access all of

                IoT devices pose an even greater risk than your other computing devices. While desktop, laptop and
                mobile platforms receive frequent software updates, most IoT devices have their original software. If
                vulnerabilities are found in the software, the IoT device is likely to be vulnerable. And to make the
                problem worse, IoT devices require Internet access, most often relying on your local network. The result
                is that when IoT devices are compromised, they allow hackers access to your local network and data. The
                best way to protect yourself from this scenario is to set up any IoT devices on an isolated network.

                    3.1.3 Wireless Network Security at Home
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Wireless networks allow Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops and tablets, to connect to the
                    network by way of a preset network identifier, known as the service set identifier (SSID). Although
                    a wireless router can be configured so that it doesn’t broadcast the SSID, this should not be
                    considered adequate security for a wireless network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hackers will be aware of the preset SSID and default password. Therefore, these details should be
                    changed to prevent intruders from entering your home wireless network. Furthermore, you should
                    encrypt wireless communication by enabling wireless security and the WPA2 encryption feature on your
                    wireless router. But be aware, even with WPA2 encryption enabled, a wireless network can still be
                    vulnerable.
