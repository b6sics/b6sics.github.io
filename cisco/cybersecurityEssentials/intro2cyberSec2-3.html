            <p>
                Before we get into the details, let’s start by outlining some key terms that you need to know.
            </p>
            <p>
                Security vulnerabilities are any kind of software or hardware defect. A program written to take
                advantage of a known vulnerability is referred to as an exploit. A cybercriminal can use an exploit
                against a vulnerability to carry out an attack, the goal of which is to gain access to a system, the
                data it hosts or a specific resource.

                    2.3.1 Hardware Vulnerabilities
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Hardware vulnerabilities are most often the result of hardware design flaws. For example, the type
                    of memory called RAM basically consists of lots of capacitors (a component which can hold an
                    electrical charge) installed very close to one another. However, it was soon discovered that, due to
                    their close proximity, changes applied to one of these capacitors could influence neighbor
                    capacitors. Based on this design flaw, an exploit called Rowhammer was created. By repeatedly
                    accessing (hammering) a row of memory, the Rowhammer exploit triggers electrical interferences that
                    eventually corrupt the data stored inside the RAM.
                </p>

                    <b>
                        Meltdown and Spectre
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Google security researchers discovered Meltdown and Spectre, two hardware vulnerabilities that
                    affect almost all central processing units (CPUs) released since 1995 within desktops, laptops,
                    servers, smartphones, smart devices and cloud services.
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="intro2cybersec.img/meltdown.png" alt="" title="" width="auto" height="auto" />
                </figure>
                <p>
                    Attackers exploiting these vulnerabilities can read all memory from a given system (Meltdown), as
                    well as data handled by other applications (Spectre). The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerability
                    exploitations are referred to as side-channel attacks (information is gained from the implementation
                    of a computer system). They have the ability to compromise large amounts of memory data because the
                    attacks can be run multiple times on a system with very little possibility of a crash or other
                    error.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Hardware vulnerabilities are specific to device models and are not generally exploited through
                    random compromising attempts. While hardware exploits are more common in highly targeted attacks,
                    traditional malware protection and good physical security are sufficient protection for the everyday
                    user.

                    2.3.2 Software Vulnerabilities
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Software vulnerabilities are usually introduced by errors in the operating system or application
                    code.
                </p>

                            The SYNful Knock vulnerability allowed attackers to gain control of enterprise-grade
                            routers, such
                            as the legacy Cisco ISR routers, from which they could monitor all network communication and
                            infect
                            other network devices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This vulnerability was introduced into the system when an altered IOS version was installed
                            on the
                            routers. To avoid this, you should always verify the integrity of the downloaded IOS image
                            and limit
                            the physical access of such equipment to authorized personnel only.
