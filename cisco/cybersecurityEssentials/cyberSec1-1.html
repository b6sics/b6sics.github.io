            Module 1 - Cybersecurity Threats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks
        </h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                Welcome to this module, which aims to explore the range of cybersecurity risks and threats that are
                ever-present in our world today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cybercriminals are constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities in systems and networks, often
                with the intention of stealing sensitive information and/or money.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a cybersecurity professional, you must be able to consider the possibility of a cyber attack
                occurring (a threat), recognize what makes a target susceptible to an attack (a vulnerability) and
                understand the different types of cyber attacks and their effects.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    With organizations facing an ever-growing number of cyber threats, it is critical that they have
                    robust security solutions in place. But in order to protect themselves, organizations first need to
                    know what vulnerabilities exist within their threat domains. A ‘threat domain’ is considered to be
                    an area of control, authority or protection that attackers can exploit to gain access to a system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many ways that attackers can uncover vulnerabilities and exploit systems within a domain.
                </p>
