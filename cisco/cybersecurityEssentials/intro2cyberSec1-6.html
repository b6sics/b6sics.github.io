                        <p>
                            An employee is laid off after fifteen years with the same company. The employee is then
                            hired by another company within a week. In the new company, the employee shares documents
                            and ideas for products that the employee proposed at the original company.
                        </p>

                                Even though the employee was laid off, the employee probably signed a Non-Disclosure
                                Agreement (NDA) with the original company. Any work or idea developed at the original
                                company, regardless of who proposed the idea, is still the property of the original
                                company. Depending on the level of severity of the breach, this could result in legal
                                action.
