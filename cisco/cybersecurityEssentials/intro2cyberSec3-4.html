                <p>
                    Popular online services, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple and Microsoft, use two
                    factor authentication to add an extra layer of security for account logins.

                            Besides your username and password or personal identification number (PIN), two factor
                            authentication requires a second token to verify your identity. This may be a:

                <p>
                    Open authorization (OAuth) is an open standard protocol that allows you to use your credentials to
                    access third-party applications without exposing your password.

                        in this series, to help you develop your career. But you must be logged into the eLearning
                        portal to do so.

                        You can’t remember your login details, but that’s OK. The portal gives you the option of logging
                        in using your credentials from a social media website such as Facebook or via another account
                        such as Google.

                <p><b>Explanation:</b></p>
                <p>
                    In order to safeguard your privacy on social media, it’s important to share as little personal
                    information as possible. You should also check your social media settings so that only people you
                    know can see your activities or engage in conversations with you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The more information you share online, the easier it is for someone to create a profile about you
                    and take advantage of you, both online and offline.

                    A simple forged or spoofed email can lead to a massive data breach and perhaps cause irreversible

                The Internet is a great tool for not only accessing information quickly and easily but also for
                communicating with friends, family and colleagues. But did you know that anyone with physical access to
                your device or router can view what websites you’ve visited? And that every time you send an email, it
                is readable by anyone who has access to the digital chain between you and your recipient?
            </p>

            <p>
                So, what can you do?

                </h3>

                <p>
                    These problems can be minimized by enabling the in-private browsing mode on your web browser. Many
                    of the most commonly used web browsers have their own name for private browser mode:
                </p>
                <ul>

                        <b>Google Chrome:</b> Incognito
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Mozilla Firefox:</b> Private tab or private window
                    </li>

                        <b>Safari:</b> Private browsing
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            When private mode is enabled, cookies — files saved to your device to indicate what websites
                            you’ve visited — are disabled. Therefore, any temporary internet files are removed and your
                            browsing history is deleted when you close the window or program. This may help to prevent
                            others from gathering information about your online activities and trying to entice you to
                            buy something with targeted ads.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even with private browsing enabled and cookies disabled, companies are constantly developing
                            new ways of fingerprinting users in order to track their online behavior. For example, some
                            intermediary devices, like routers, can gather information about a user’s web surfing
                            history.

                    Ultimately, it is your responsibility to safeguard your data, your identity and your computing
                    devices. So, the next time you go to send an email or browse the Internet, why not check to make
                    sure you’re following all the guidelines outlined in this module? Just a few simple precautions now
                    could save you from having to deal with problems later.
