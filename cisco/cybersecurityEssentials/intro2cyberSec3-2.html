                There are some simple strategies that you can use to protect your personal devices and maintain your

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Encryption is the process of converting information into a form in which unauthorized parties cannot
                    read it. Only a trusted, authorized person with the secret key or password can decrypt the data and
                    access it in its original form.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p>
                    Note that the encryption itself does not prevent someone from intercepting the data. It can only
                    prevent an unauthorized person from viewing or accessing the content. In fact, some criminals may
                    decide to simply encrypt your data and make it unusable until you pay a ransom.

                    Software programs are used to encrypt files, folders and even entire drives.

                <p>
                    Encrypting File System (EFS) is a Windows feature that can encrypt data. It is directly linked to a
                    specific user account and only the user that encrypts the data will be able to access it after it
                    has been encrypted using EFS.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Having a backup may prevent the loss of irreplaceable data. To back up data properly, you will need
                    an additional storage location for the data and you must copy the data to that location regularly.

                        scenario, you are the owner of the data and you are totally responsible for the cost and
                        maintenance of the storage device equipment.

                        You could subscribe to a cloud storage service, like Amazon Web Services (AWS). The cost of this
                        service will depend on the amount of storage space you need, so you may need to be more
                        selective about what data you back up. You will have access to your backup data as long as you
                        have access to your <br />
                        One of the benefits of using a cloud storage service is that your data is safe in the event of a
