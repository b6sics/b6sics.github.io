        <article>
            <p>
                Welcome to this module, which will outline the various strategies and tools used by cybersecurity
                professionals to protect an organization’s network, data and equipment from cybercrime.
            </p>
            <p>
                You only have to look at the news to understand that all organizations, regardless of type, size or
                location, are at risk of a cyber attack. It seems that no one is safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                So is there anything you can do to help protect an organization from a targeted attack? And with many in
                the security industry predicting that it’s not a case of ‘if’ but ‘when’ a cybersecurity breach will
                occur, how can you respond to ensure that it has minimal impact?
            </p>
            <p>
                This module will highlight the actions that you can take to help answer these questions.

                There is no single security appliance or piece of technology that will solve all the network security
                needs in an organization. You must consider what tools will be most effective as part of your security
                system.

                    4.1.1 Security Appliances
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Security appliances can be standalone devices like a router or software tools that are run on a
                    network device. They fall into six general categories.

                            While routers are primarily used to interconnect various network segments together, they
                            usually also provide basic traffic filtering capabilities. This information can help you
                            define which computers from a given network segment can communicate with which network
                            segments.

                            Firewalls can look deeper into the network traffic itself and identify malicious behavior
                            that has to be blocked. Firewalls can have sophisticated security policies applied to the
                            traffic that is passing through them.

                            and securely connect back to the organization’s network. VPN systems can also securely
                            interconnect branch offices with the central office network.

                    4.1.3 Firewalls
                </h3>

                <p>
                    In computer networking, a firewall is designed to control or filter which communications are allowed
                    in and which are allowed out of a device or network. A firewall can be installed on a single
                    computer with the purpose of protecting that one computer (host-based firewall) or it can be a
                    standalone network device that protects an entire network of computers and all of the host devices
                    on that network (network-based firewall)
                </p>

                <p>
                    As computer and network attacks have become more sophisticated, new types of firewalls have been
                    developed, which serve different purposes.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    In networking, each application running on a device is assigned an identifier called a port number.
                    This port number is used on both ends of the transmission so that the right data is passed to the
                    correct application. Port scanning is a process of probing a computer, server or other network host
                    for open ports. It can be used maliciously as a reconnaissance tool to identify the operating system
                    and services running on a computer or host, or it can be used harmlessly by a network administrator
                    to verify network security policies on the network.

                        The port scan reported an ‘open’ state response. This means that the service running on the

                            An ‘open’ state response means that the service running on the network can be accessed by
                            other networks and if the service does contain a vulnerability, it could be exploited by an

                            It’s important to note that port scanning should be seen as a precursor to a network attack
                            and therefore should never be carried out on public servers on the internet or on an
                            organization's network without permission.

                    4.1.7 Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are security measures
                    deployed on a network to detect and prevent malicious activities.
                </p>

                <figure>
                    <p>
                        <b>IDS</b>
                    </p>
                    <img src="intro2cybersec.img/intrusionDetection.png" alt="" title="" width="auto" height="auto" />
                    <figcaption>
                        <p>
                            An IDS can either be a dedicated network device or one of several tools in a server,
                            firewall or even a host computer operating system, such as Windows or Linux, that scans data
                            against a database of rules or attack signatures, looking for malicious traffic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a match is detected, the IDS will log the detection and create an alert for a network
                            administrator. It will not take action and therefore it will not prevent attacks from
                            happening. The job of the IDS is to detect, log and report.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The scanning performed by the IDS slows down the network (known as latency). To prevent
                            network delay, an IDS is usually placed offline, separate from regular network traffic. Data
                            is copied or mirrored by a switch and then forwarded to the IDS for offline detection. </p>

                            An IPS can block or deny traffic based on a positive rule or signature match. One of the
                            most well-known IPS/IDS systems is Snort. The commercial version of Snort is Cisco’s
                            Sourcefire. Sourcefire can perform real-time traffic and port analysis, logging, content
                            searching and matching, as well as detect probes, attacks and execute port scans. It also
                            integrates with other third-party tools for reporting, performance and log analysis.

                Software is not perfect. And more than ever before, hackers are exploiting flaws in software before
                creators get a chance to fix them. When they do this, hackers are said to have carried out a
                zero-day attack!
            </p>
            <p>
                The ability to detect these attacks in real time, and stop them immediately, or within minutes of
                occurring, is the ultimate goal.

                            Detecting attacks in real time requires actively scanning for attacks using firewall and

                            connections to online global threat centers must also be used. Today, active scanning
                            devices and software must detect network anomalies using context-based analysis and behavior
                            detection.

                            DDoS is one of the biggest attack threats requiring real-time detection and response. For
                            many organizations, regularly occurring DDoS attacks cripple Internet servers and network
                            availability. These attacks are extremely difficult to defend against because the attacks
                            originate from hundreds, even thousands, of zombie hosts, and the attacks appear as
                            legitimate traffic.

                    This is client/server software that can be deployed on host endpoints, as a standalone server or on

                    of millions of other analyzed malware artifacts for behaviors that reveal an APT. This approach
                    provides a global view of malware attacks, campaigns and their distribution.
