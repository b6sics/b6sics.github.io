                    Before you can start implementing best practices to safeguard organizational data, you need to know
                    what it is. In organizations like eLearning company @Apollo, there are two main types of data that
                    you should be aware of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let’s explore these now.

                    <p>
                        Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small.
                        It includes the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Transactional data such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities
                            and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment
                            decisions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an
                            organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often
                            considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a
                            company.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Financial data such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which
                            provide insight into the health of a company.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All
                        of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And
                        given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise
                        that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of
                        interest in technology and business called 'Big Data'.
