                    Before you can start implementing best practices to safeguard organizational data, you need to know
                    what it is. In organizations like eLearning company @Apollo, there are two main types of data that
                    you should be aware of.
                </p>[]
                <p>
                    Let’s explore these now.

                    <p>
                        Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations, big and small.
                        It includes the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Transactional data such as details relating to buying and selling, production activities
                            and basic organizational operations such as any information used to make employment
                            decisions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Intellectual property such as patents, trademarks and new product plans, which allows an
                            organization to gain economic advantage over its competitors. This information is often
                            considered a trade secret and losing it could prove disastrous for the future of a
                            company.

                            Financial data such as income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements, which
                            provide insight into the health of a company.

                        IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All
                        of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data. And
                        given that storage options are expanding through the cloud and virtualization, it’s no surprise
                        that the emergence of IoT has led to an exponential growth in data, creating a new area of
                        interest in technology and business called 'Big Data'.

                                    not. This can be achieved by maintaining equipment, performing hardware repairs,
                                    keeping operating systems and software up to date, and creating backups.

                        Phishing emails can be hard to detect. For example, they will often address you by name to
                        appear legitimate, but hackers can easily find this information on the Internet. So, it’s
                        important to stay alert and think before you click.

                    1.2.4 Is This for Real?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, phishing is very common and often works. For example, in August 2020, elite gaming brand Razer
                    experienced a data breach which exposed the personal information of approximately 100,000 customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A security consultant discovered that a cloud cluster (a group of linked servers providing data
                    storage, databases, networking, and software through the Internet), was misconfigured and exposed a
                    segment of Razer’s infrastructure to the public Internet, resulting in a data leak.
                </p>
                <img src="intro2cybersec.img/RAZER.png" alt="" title="" width="auto" height="auto" />
                <p>
                    It took Razer more than three weeks to secure the cloud instance from public access, during which
                    time cybercriminals had access to customer information that could have been used in social
                    engineering and fraud attacks, like the one you uncovered just now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Organizations therefore need to take a proactive approach to cloud security to ensure that sensitive
                    data is secured.

                            <b>The Persirai botnet</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2017, an Internet of Things (IoT) botnet, Persirai, targeted over 1,000 different models
                            of Internet Protocol (IP) cameras, accessing open ports to inject a command that forced the
                            cameras to connect to a site which installed malware on them. Once the malware was
                            downloaded and executed, it deleted itself and was therefore able to run in memory to avoid
                            detection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over 122,000 of these cameras from several different manufacturers were hijacked and used to
                            carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, without the knowledge of their
                            owners. A DDoS attack occurs when multiple devices infected with malware flood the resources
                            of a targeted system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The IoT is connecting more and more devices, creating more opportunities for cybercriminals
                            to attack.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In September 2017, Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency in the United States,
                            publicly announced a data breach event: Attackers had been able to exploit a vulnerability
                            in its web application software to gain access to the sensitive personal data of millions of
                            customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In response to this breach, Equifax established a dedicated website that allowed Equifax
                            customers to determine if their information was compromised. However, instead of using a
                            subdomain of equifax.com, the company set up a new domain name, which allowed cybercriminals
                            to create unauthorized websites with similar names. These websites were used to try and
                            trick customers into providing personal information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Attackers could use this information to assume a customer’s identity. In such cases, it
                            would be very difficult for the customer to prove otherwise, given that the hacker is also
                            privy to their personal information.

                    If you are ever faced with a similar situation, quickly verify if your information was compromised,
                    so that you can minimize the impact. Keep in mind that, in a time of crisis, you may be tricked into
                    using unauthorized websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always be vigilant when providing personally identifiable information over the Internet. Check your
                    credit reports regularly and immediately report any false information, such as applications for
                    credit that you did not initiate or purchases on your credit cards that you did not make.

                        A security breach can have a negative long-term impact on an organization’s reputation that has
                        taken years to build. Customers, particularly those who have been adversely affected by the
                        breach, will need to be notified and may seek compensation and/or turn to a reliable and secure
                        competitor. Employees may also choose to leave in light of a scandal.

                        They might even just make a few minor edits to your organization’s phone number or address,
                        which can be trickier to detect.

                        A data breach often involves an incident where sensitive personal data has been stolen.
                        Cybercriminals can make this information public or exploit it to steal an individual’s money
                        and/or identity.

                        The financial impact of a security breach can be devastating. For example, hackers can take down
                        an organization’s website, preventing it from doing business online. A loss of customer
                        information may impede company growth and expansion. It may demand further investment in an
                        organization’s security infrastructure. And let’s not forget that organizations may face large
                        fines or penalties if they do not protect online data.
