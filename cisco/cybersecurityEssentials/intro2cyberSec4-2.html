        </h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                Welcome to this module, which will outline the various strategies and tools used by cybersecurity
                professionals to protect an organization’s network, data and equipment from cybercrime.
            </p>
            <p>
                You only have to look at the news to understand that all organizations, regardless of type, size or
                location, are at risk of a cyber attack. It seems that no one is safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                So is there anything you can do to help protect an organization from a targeted attack? And with many in
                the security industry predicting that it’s not a case of ‘if’ but ‘when’ a cybersecurity breach will
                occur, how can you respond to ensure that it has minimal impact?
            </p>
            <p>
                This module will highlight the actions that you can take to help answer these questions.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Behavior-based security is a form of threat detection that involves capturing and analyzing the flow
                    of communication between a user on the local network and a local or remote destination. Any changes
                    in normal patterns of behavior are regarded as anomalies, and may indicate an attack.

                        <p>
                            A honeypot is a behavior-based detection tool that lures the attacker in by appealing to
                            their predicted pattern of malicious behavior. Once the attacker is inside the honeypot, the
                            network administrator can capture, log and analyze their behavior so that they can build a
                            better defense.

                            This security architecture uses behavior-based detection and indicators to provide greater
                            visibility, context and control. The aim is to know who is carrying out the attack, what
                            type of attack they are performing and where, when and how the attack is taking place. This
                            security architecture uses many security technologies to achieve this goal.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    NetFlow technology is used to gather information about data flowing through a network, including who
                    and what devices are in the network, and when and how users and devices access the network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    NetFlow is an important component in behavior-based detection and analysis. Switches, routers and
                    firewalls equipped with NetFlow can report information about data entering, leaving and traveling
                    through the network.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This information is sent to NetFlow collectors that collect, store and analyze NetFlow data, which
                    can be used to establish baseline behaviors on more than 90 attributes, such as source and
                    destination IP address.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Penetration testing, commonly known as pen testing, is the act of assessing a computer system,
                    network or organization for security vulnerabilities. A pen test seeks to breach systems, people,
                    processes and code to uncover vulnerabilities which could be exploited. This information is then
                    used to improve the system’s defenses to ensure that it is better able to withstand cyber attacks in
                    the future.

                        The pen tester gathers as much information as possible about a target system or network, its
                        potential vulnerabilities and exploits to use against it. This involves conducting passive or
                        active reconnaissance (footprinting) and vulnerability research.

                    <p>
                        The pen tester will maintain access to the target to find out what data and systems are
                        vulnerable to exploitation. It is important that they remain undetected, typically using
                        backdoors, Trojan horses, rootkits and other covert channels to hide their presence.

                        When this infrastructure is in place, the pen tester will then proceed to gather the data that

                </h3>

                <p>
                    While most organizations today are aware of common security threats and put considerable effort into
                    preventing them, no set of security practices is foolproof. Therefore, organizations must be
                    prepared to contain the damage if a security breach occurs. And they must act fast!

                        Attackers will often attempt to leave a backdoor to facilitate future breaches. To prevent this

                        else has been compromised.
