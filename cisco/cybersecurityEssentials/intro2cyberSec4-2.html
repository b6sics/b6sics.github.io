            Module 4 - Protecting the Organization
        </h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                Welcome to this module, which will outline the various strategies and tools used by cybersecurity
                professionals to protect an organization’s network, data and equipment from cybercrime.
            </p>
            <p>
                You only have to look at the news to understand that all organizations, regardless of type, size or
                location, are at risk of a cyber attack. It seems that no one is safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                So is there anything you can do to help protect an organization from a targeted attack? And with many in
                the security industry predicting that it’s not a case of ‘if’ but ‘when’ a cybersecurity breach will
                occur, how can you respond to ensure that it has minimal impact?
            </p>
            <p>
                This module will highlight the actions that you can take to help answer these questions.

                    4.2.1 Behavior-Based Security
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Behavior-based security is a form of threat detection that involves capturing and analyzing the flow
                    of communication between a user on the local network and a local or remote destination. Any changes
                    in normal patterns of behavior are regarded as anomalies, and may indicate an attack.

                        <p>
                            A honeypot is a behavior-based detection tool that lures the attacker in by appealing to
                            their predicted pattern of malicious behavior. Once the attacker is inside the honeypot, the
                            network administrator can capture, log and analyze their behavior so that they can build a
                            better defense.

                            This security architecture uses behavior-based detection and indicators to provide greater
                            visibility, context and control. The aim is to know who is carrying out the attack, what
                            type of attack they are performing and where, when and how the attack is taking place. This
                            security architecture uses many security technologies to achieve this goal.
