            Module 4 - Protecting the Organization
        </h2>

        <article>
            <p>
                Welcome to this module, which will outline the various strategies and tools used by cybersecurity
                professionals to protect an organization’s network, data and equipment from cybercrime.
            </p>
            <p>
                You only have to look at the news to understand that all organizations, regardless of type, size or
                location, are at risk of a cyber attack. It seems that no one is safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                So is there anything you can do to help protect an organization from a targeted attack? And with many in
                the security industry predicting that it’s not a case of ‘if’ but ‘when’ a cybersecurity breach will
                occur, how can you respond to ensure that it has minimal impact?
            </p>
            <p>
                This module will highlight the actions that you can take to help answer these questions.

            <p>
                Cybersecurity is becoming a significant business concern. Organizations should therefore have plans in
                place to prepare for, deal with, and recover from a security breach.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here at @Apollo, we use Cisco technology. Let’s check these out.

                    4.3.1 Cisco's CSIRT
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Many large organizations have a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) to receive, review
                    and respond to computer security incident reports. Cisco CSIRT goes a step further and provides
                    proactive threat assessment, mitigation planning, incident trend analysis and security architecture
                    review in an effort to prevent security incidents from happening.
                </p>

                <img src="intro2cybersec.img/certificates.png" alt="" title="" width="auto" height="auto" />

                <p>
                    Cisco’s CSIRT takes a proactive approach, collaborating with the Forum of Incident Response and
                    Security Teams (FIRST), the National Safety Information Exchange (NSIE), the Defense Security
                    Information Exchange (DSIE) and the DNS Operations Analysis and Research Center (DNS-OARC) to ensure
                    we stay up-to-date with new developments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several national and public CSIRT organizations, like the CERT Division of the Software
                    Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, that are available to help organizations and
                    national CSIRTs to develop, operate and improve their incident management capabilities.

                    4.3.2 Security Playbook
                </h3>

                <p>
                    One of the best ways to prepare for a security breach is to prevent it. Organizations should provide
                    guidance on:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        how to identify the cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data and capabilities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the implementation of safeguards and personnel training
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a flexible response plan that minimizes the impact and damage in the event of a security breach
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        security measures and processes that need to be put in place in the aftermath of a security
                        breach.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    All this information should be compiled into a security playbook.
                </p>

                            A security playbook is a collection of repeatable queries or reports that outline a
                            standardized process for incident detection and response. Ideally, a security playbook
                            should:

                                detection of malware-infected machines, suspicious network activity or irregular
                                authentication attempts

                            data at rest (data stored in a computer network or device).
