                Attackers are individuals or groups who attempt to exploit vulnerability for personal or financial gain.
                As we’ve already seen, they are interested in everything, from credit cards to product designs!

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Let’s look at some of the main types of cyber attackers who’ll try anything to get their hands on
                    our information. They are often categorized as white hat, gray hat or black hat attackers.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            The term 'script kiddies' emerged in the 1990s and refers to amateur or inexperienced
                            hackers who use existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks. Some
                            script kiddies are just curious, others are trying to demonstrate their skills and cause
                            harm. While these white hat attackers may use basic tools, their attacks can still have
                            devastating consequences.

                        <p>
                            This group of attackers break into computer systems or networks to gain access. Depending on
                            the intent of their break in, they can be classified as white, gray or black hat hackers.
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                                <b>White hat attackers</b> break into networks or computer systems to identify any
                                weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved. These break-ins
                                are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.

                                <b>Gray hat attackers</b> may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will
                                only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their
                                agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vulnerability on the internet so
                                that other attackers can exploit it.

                            state-sponsored hackers. They are usually highly sophisticated and organized, and may even
                            provide cybercrime as a service to other criminals.

                    White hat attackers aim to discover security weaknesses so that they can be improved, whereas black
                    hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerabilities for illegal personal, financial or political
                    gain. Gray hat attackers are somewhere in between. While they may not have malicious intentions,
                    they want to get something for their discovery.

                        This ex-employee was able to launch an attack based on insider knowledge of the organization’s
                        network. For this reason, internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than
                        external threats.
