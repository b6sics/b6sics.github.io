                    Security breaches today are all too common, with attackers constantly finding new and innovative
                    ways of infiltrating organizations in search of valuable information.

                        1.3.1.1 Marriott Suffers Another Credential-Based Breach
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        The Story
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        On March 31, 2020, Marriott posted an announcement that "an unexpected amount of guest
                        information may have been accessed using the login credentials of two employees at a franchise
                        property." That "unexpected amount" turned out to be the data of 5.2 million guests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This news is particularly unfortunate for Marriott since it's only been two years since it
                        discovered another massive breach, stemming from its acquisition of Starwood Hotels.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        How the Breach Happened
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        We know that a hacker obtained the credentials of two employees at a Marriott property and used
                        them to siphon data for roughly a month before being discovered. We don't know how that hacker
                        obtained employee credentials, but credential stuffing and phishing are both likely culprits.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What Data Was Exposed
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Help Net Security reports that the attacker accessed a wide range of personal data, including
                        contact information, personal details like gender and birthday, and linked account data like
                        airline loyalty programs.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        The Lesson for Businesses
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>To protect customer data, you have to control how employees access data rigorously.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Marriott could have avoided this breach by implementing multi-factor authentication for
                        employees attempting to access sensitive data. That way, it would have taken more than a
                        password for the attacker to sneak into their systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, Marriott could have gotten wise to the hacker's presence much sooner if their IAM
                        system had monitored for suspicious behavior. Such a system would have flagged the situation
                        —two employees at a franchise location accessing millions of guest records— as an anomaly that
                        merited investigation.

                        1.3.1.2 Slickwraps and the Case of the "White Hat" Hacker
                    </h3>
                    <h4>
                        The Story
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Slickwraps, a company that lets users design custom skins for their electronics, was embroiled
                        in a data breach story The Verge called "comically bad." The breach started when someone claimed
                        to be a "white hat" hacker who tried to alert the company about its "abysmal cybersecurity".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, Slickwraps ignored them, so the hacker published a now-deleted Medium post about
                        the experience. A second hacker read this post and exploited Slickwraps' vulnerability, hacking
                        the company. In a particularly egregious touch, the hacker then emailed all the customers to
                        notify them that their data had been compromised.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        How the Breach Happened
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The company's phone customization tool was vulnerable to remote code execution. Users needed to
                        be able to upload their custom photos, but Slickwraps let them upload any file to the highest
                        directory on the server. So this hacker uploaded a file that allowed them to achieve remote code
                        execution and execute shell commands. (In the Medium post, the hacker called this "akin to
                        obtaining a skeleton key").
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What Data Was Exposed
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Per the original hacker, the vulnerability gave them nearly free rein over Slickwraps' systems,
                        including access to customer photos, billing and shipping addresses, admin account details, and
                        the resumes of all employees.

                    <h4>
                        The Story
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In March 2020, SafetyDetectives — a pro bono team of security researchers — revealed a breach in
                        the data of Antheus Tecnologia, a Brazilian biometric solutions company. The company had left
                        sensitive information, including data on 76,000 fingerprints, exposed on an unsecured server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The server didn't store direct scans of fingerprints, but binary code that hackers could use to
                        recreate them, with potentially disastrous consequences.
                    </p>
                    <img src="intro2cybersec.img/antheusDatabreach.png" alt="" title="" width="auto" height="auto" />
                    <h4>
                        How the Breach Happened
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        As we mentioned, the company neglected to password protect a database on the cloud or properly
                        encrypt it. This is almost certainly the result of human error on the part of IT staff.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What Data Was Exposed
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Per Biometric Update: "The vulnerable server contained roughly 16 gigabytes of data, with 81.5
                        million records also including administrator login information, employee telephone numbers,
                        email addresses, and company emails".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Antheus Tecnologia responded to the report by insisting that the exposed fingerprints belonged
                        to their team or were in the public domain. However, they also claimed that the data was hashed,
                        which was not the case.
                    </p>

                        The Lesson for Businesses
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Password protect all sensitive data when migrating to the cloud and apply the same controls
                            you would apply on-premises.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the worst data breaches on this list result from misconfiguration errors when
                        transitioning to the cloud. According to Verizon's 2020 Data Breach Report, errors are now the
                        second most common source of breaches, ahead of malware and only behind the hacking. In
                        particular, misconfiguration errors have dramatically increased since 2017, though the
                        researchers acknowledge this is mostly due to "internet-exposed storage discovered by security
                        researchers and unrelated third parties".

                    According to our sources, a well known hotel chain that operates across the world has reported a
                    massive data breach, with the personal information of over three million guests exposed to hackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hotel discovered that hackers gained access to its customer database by using the login details
                    of one of its employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, the hotel doesn’t believe that the hackers were able to access any account passwords
                    or financial information. Recent guests are encouraged to check the hotel chain’s web portal to see
                    if they have been impacted by this breach.

                <p>
                    The team at @Apollo is concerned. eLearning platforms are becoming prime targets for attackers as
                    more and more organizations make the move to digital learning.

                        A popular online training platform admitted leaving the personal data of millions of its
                        students (many of them minors) exposed on a publicly accessible cloud database.

                <p>
                    In this scenario, hackers were able to take advantage of an organization’s poor security practices.
                    Unsecured cloud databases left exposed on the Internet present a huge vulnerability and one that
                    attackers will seek to exploit to gain easy access to valuable organizational data.

                        1.3.4.1 The Top 4 Hacker Mindset Characteristics
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        In The Secret History of Hacking, they spend a lot of time talking about how hackers “think
                        differently” from other people. Given the big red button example, I would say I agree, but
                        neuroscience has taught us a lot about brain plasticity since that documentary was made. Even if
                        you don’t naturally lean towards hacking, I think there’s a case to be made that computers have
                        taught people to push buttons to find answers. These characteristics can be found in many
                        professions: many athletes, artists, and business leaders rely on the same four.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>
                            Curiosity:
                        </b>
                        If I had to pick only one characteristic, curiosity could probably be expanded to include the
                        other three. But anyone engaged in ethical hacking or “hackerlike” behavior is curious about how
                        things work. If they push the red button, what happens? If they send just the right packet, can
                        they break into the system? If they ask the right set of questions when they call the front
                        desk, can they get an executive’s email address?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>
                            Creativity:
                        </b>
                        Different people define creativity differently. For me, it’s about how you approach a problem.
                        For example, I typically don’t want access to the code base when I’m helping test an app or
                        platform. I want to come at it the way the user might encounter it in the wild. This constraint
                        increases my ability to come up with interesting approaches, forcing creativity, where knowing
                        the code base or architecture gives me far too many options but is useful. Constraints help
                        force creativity.

                        <b>
                            Respect for diversity of thought:
                        </b>
                        The internet is not the work of one person. I know that may seem obvious, but thousands of minds
                        (maybe hundreds of thousands) make all the apps and sites we use to get food, learn, access
                        healthcare, and make sure we have enough funds to shop at our favorite retail sites. As I
                        mentioned earlier, the internet was born to share information; we can describe security and
                        privacy as being “bolted on.” All those minds all over the world are doing things in different
                        ways at the same time; bad actors are also all over the world figuring out ever-evolving
                        attacks. It just doesn’t make sense to put together a security team of people who come from the
                        same background, went to the same college to study with the same teachers, and end up listening
                        to the same music and sharing the same meme content. Different people come at problems
                        differently. This makes diverse teams more effective at securing sites, winning DEF CON black
                        badges (more on that in the next section), and really doing anything —and there’s recent
                        research that says diversity of thought even helped teams do better during the pandemic.

                        <b>
                            Tenacious:
                        </b>
                        Ethical hackers and malicious actors strongly share the characteristic of stubbornly not giving
                        up. Neither of us is going to have a look at your app, click the mouse a few times, and decide
                        we can’t break into it. Code is written by humans, so it’s fallible. That means sooner or later;
                        we will come up with a vulnerability. An ethical hacker may have been hired to do this for a
                        company or may be operating independently, in which case it’s good to help ethical hackers know
                        how to reach your security team. Like I said, I am stubborn. When I was operating independently,
                        I wouldn’t stop at not being able to easily reach your security team for a serious issue. I
                        would have reached out to your sales team. Tell the sales people there’s a problem with the
                        security of their product, and you’ll get a response. They’re tenacious, too.

                <p>
                    A security breach is an incident that results in unauthorized access to data, applications, services
                    or devices, exposing private information that attackers can use for financial gain or other
                    advantages.

                <p>
                    But there are many ways to protect yourself and your organization. It’s important to be aware of
                    common cyber threats and remain vigilant so that you don’t become the next victim.

                        Back in the early days of blogging, millions of people took to LiveJournal to air their secrets,
                        form communities, and write reams of fanfic. In May, many of those users had an unpleasant shock
                        when Bleeping Computer reported that hackers were passing around a database containing 26
                        million login credentials.

                    <p>
                        The most damning part of this story is that rumors about this leak had been circulating since
                        2014. LiveJournal has still not publicly acknowledged the breach. That left users vulnerable,
                        and Threatpost reports that hackers have been using the information for both credential stuffing
                        and targeted email-based extortion.

                        The database contains email addresses, user names, and unencrypted passwords. Typically, this
                        type of data would only have value as a tool to enable further credential stuffing attacks.
                        However, blogging's highly personal nature means that hackers can use private drafts and
                        messages for blackmail.

                    <p>
                        Storing plaintext passwords, as LiveJournal seems to have done, is a big no-no, and they should
                        have changed their policies to keep up with best practices.

                    <p>
                        The second lesson is even more fundamental. Mistakes happen. But in the event of a breach,
                        inform your users so they can protect their identities. How you handle a breach will be critical
                        to navigating the incident and regaining customer trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third lesson is foundational. Invest in experienced cybersecurity personnel. Even if you
                        spend your max dollars on cybersecurity and check all the necessary boxes, you still need smart
                        people to make sure it can all work together — and who knows what to do when it doesn't.

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In October 2019, Canadian medical testing company LifeLabs was hacked in the biggest data breach
                        in Canadian history. (This data breach story technically came to light in December 2019, but the
                        scandal deepened in the new year, so it still makes a list.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The breach exposed the data of 15 million Canadians — 40% of the country's population. The
                        company claimed that they paid to retrieve the data, but that still leaves the strong
                        possibility that the hacker copied it. In the wake of this news, three parties filed
                        class-action lawsuits against LifeLabs, the largest of which is for over $1 billion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an unfortunate coda, LifeLabs attempted to make amends by offering a year of free credit
                        monitoring to victims. However, many Canadian customers took issue with the program, since it
                        was operated by TransUnion, which was the victim of a recent breach.

                    <p>
                        According to CPO Magazine, the language used in one of the lawsuits offers clues about how the
                        breach occurred. "It alleges that the data in question was stored on unsecured servers and not
                        encrypted. It also alleges that the network security personnel responsible for securing the data
                        were not properly trained and that there was not enough staff."

                        Hackers compromised lab test results and national health card numbers, which revealed names,

                        Wishbone is a popular social app, especially among young teens. In May, cybersecurity
                        researchers discovered that hackers were selling a database with over 40 million user records on
                        the dark web. This incident is particularly troubling given the young age of many of Wishbone's
                        users and the apparent lack of appropriate safeguards for their data.

                        As of yet, we don't know how the hackers gained access to the database. However,
                        BleepingComputer reports that the hacker group "Shiny Hunters" leaked the database. Shiny
                        Hunters have been responsible for numerous high-profile breaches, though it's unclear if they
                        committed this breach or are merely leaking the data.

                    <p>
                        Researchers at Cyble found that the leaked database contained a wide variety of sensitive data,
                        including names, email addresses, geolocation, gender, phone numbers, social media profiles, and
                        passwords.

                    <p>
                        Experts pointed out that the severity of the breach could have been limited if the data had been
                        appropriately encrypted. Wishbone used MD5 password hashing, which is considered weak.

                        sensitive and should have been protected with a much stricter policy.

                    <p>
                        Verizon's 2020 report found that organized criminal groups committed 55 % of breaches, and 86%
                        were financially motivated, knowing that any company that collects and deals in data must take
                        the threat seriously. Building a security culture means accounting for threats in every decision
                        you make about your company's data.

                        In April 2020, Nintendo announced that 160,000 accounts had been breached in a presumptive
                        credential stuffing attack. Hackers had apparently been using the hijacked accounts to buy
                        coveted digital items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result of the breach, Nintendo discontinued the practice of letting users log in with their
                        Nintendo Network ID (NNID). The company also recommended that users enable two-factor
                        authentication to protect their data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nintendo is only the most recent victim of credential stuffing attacks targeting digital media.
                        Netflix, Spotify, and Disney+ have all had similar issues in recent months and years.

                    <p>
                        Nintendo said the compromised credentials were "obtained illegally by some means other than our
                        service." That strongly suggests that the affected users weren't using unique IDs and passwords.
                        So when their credentials were breached in another attack, hackers could use them to break into
                        their Nintendo accounts.

                    <p>
                        BigFooty.com is a popular app where fans of Australian football can chat about their favorite
                        sport (which is not to be confused with American or international sports, also called football).
                        But in late May, the public learned that this seemingly innocuous app had a dark side.
                        SafetyDetectives discovered 132GB of sensitive data published on an Elasticsearch database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exposed data included private messages, many of which contained racism, and other offensive
                        and damaging content. Furthermore, SafetyDetectives reported that many of these messages could
                        be traced to individual users, including "Australian police officers and government employees."
                        If malicious actors found the database, they could use this material to commit blackmail or

                        SafetyDetectives contacted BigFooty's web host, Amazon Web Services, and the Australian Cyber
                        Security Centre, who quickly shut down the server. BigFooty later posted about the breach,
                        acknowledging that "there was some unwanted interaction by unauthorized people," but "we

                    <p>
                        Many of BigFooty's users weren't registered under their real names, and this may have given both
                        users and the site's admins the false notion that their behavior on the site was anonymous.
                        However, many users shared identifiable information via messages, such as their passwords for
                        live streams, phone numbers, email addresses, and personal information.

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the breach also exposed IP addresses, and GPS data, so motivated hackers could
                        still trace information back to individuals and use shared passwords to take over more accounts.

                        The types of personally identifiable information exposed in this breach are quite alarming,
                        including full names, email addresses, sexual orientation, and chats. SafetyDetectives reported
                        finding 11 million records, including emails, which allowed their team to divide affected users
                        by country.

                        According to Kevin Krieg, technical director of the company which manages CAM4's database: "It's
                        a server that should not have an outward facing IP in the first place." This is a common mistake
                        and why having an asset inventory is in the CIS Top 20.

                        The Story

                    <p>
                        On March 13, hackers with the CLOP ransomware group launched a ransomware attack against
                        ExecuPharm, a pharmaceutical research company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once inside, the hackers encrypted the data on the affected servers and demanded a ransom to
                        decrypt it. Not only that, but they also threatened to publish the stolen data on the dark web
                        if they weren't paid. In April, it appears CLOP made good on this threat. TechCrunch reported
                        that they found "a vast cache of data, including thousands of emails, financial and accounting
                        records, user documents, and database backups, stolen from ExecuPharm's systems."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the threats, ExecuPharm's response to the attack has been laudable. They informed
                        Vermont's attorney general of the breach in April and worked hard to improve security. The
                        company reports that they hired third-party security firms to advise them, instituted "forced
                        password resets, multi-factor authentication for remote access, and endpoint protection,
                        detection, and response tools."

                    <p>
                        According to CISO MAG, the hackers gained access to ExecuPharm via a phishing campaign targeted
                        at ExecuPharm employees.

                        In ExecuPharm's letter to the Vermont AG, they disclosed that the hackers could have accessed
                        employee files containing personal information ranging from social security numbers to bank and
                        credit card numbers.

                            attacks. </b>

                    <p>
                        Sending out periodic reminders not to click on suspicious links isn't enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b> Lesson two: The data breach is only half the story. Your company's response is the other
                            half. </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ExecuPharm did everything right in handling this breach. They contacted the authorities,
                        immediately improved their security protocols, and refused to play ball with hackers. The result
                        is that, while ExecuPharm may experience some financial damage from this hack, the reputational
                        fallout will be limited.

                    <h4>
                        The Story
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In May 2020, low-cost airline EasyJet revealed that a "highly-sophisticated attacker" stole 9
                        million customers' personal data. In response, law firm PGMBM filed a class action lawsuit under
                        the GDPR for £18bn. EasyJet has faced intense criticism for failing to protect data and for
                        waiting several months to inform customers of the breach. However, legal observers predict that
                        the company will face a lighter fine since the airline industry is already struggling to survive
                        during the Coronavirus pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        How the Breach Happened
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        EasyJet has not released any details about how its systems were breached, except to say that the
                        hacker(s) seemed to be after the company's intellectual property, as opposed to its customer's
                        personal data.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What Data Was Exposed
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        There were two classes of victims in the EasyJet breach. The first was the 9 million customers
                        whose email addresses, names, and travel records were exposed. These customers may now be
                        vulnerable to phishing attacks, and possibly more aggressive targeted attacks based on their
                        travel history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, roughly 2,200 customers had their credit card details exposed, including the
                        three-digit CVV code on the backs of their cards, which could expose them to theft.
                    </p>

                        <b> Anticipate public perception. </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        EasyJet learned of the attack in January and informed the Information Commissioner's Office
                        (ICO) as required, but didn't tell their customers for four months. Even if EasyJetupheld its
                        legal responsibility and the company is correct that the hacker wasn't interested in customer
                        data, they still damaged their customers' trust by waiting so long to go public.
