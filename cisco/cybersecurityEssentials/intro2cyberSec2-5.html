                                Worms are self-replicating pieces of software that consume bandwidth on a network as
                                they propagate from system to system. They do not require a host application, unlike a
                                virus. Viruses, on the other hand, carry executable malicious code which harms the
                                target machine on which they reside.

                                overwhelmed handling false requests that it is unable to respond to legitimate ones.
