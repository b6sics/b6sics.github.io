                    2.2.1 Social Engineering
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential
                    information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey
                    on their weaknesses. For example, an attacker will call an authorized employee with an urgent
                    problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or
                    invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques in order to gain this access.
                </p>

                        <p>
                            This is when an attacker calls an individual and lies to them in an attempt to gain access
                            to privileged data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, pretending to need a person’s personal or financial data in order to confirm
                            their identity.

                    2.2.2 Denial-of-Service
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out,
                    even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service
                    to users, devices or applications.
                </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is when a network, host or application is sent an enormous amount of data at a rate
                            which it cannot handle. This causes a slowdown in transmission or response, or the device or
                            service to crash.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A packet is a collection of data that flows between a source and a receiver computer or
                            application over a network, such as the Internet. When a maliciously formatted packet is
                            sent, the receiver will be unable to handle it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, if an attacker forwards packets containing errors or improperly formatted
                            packets that cannot be identified by an application, this will cause the receiving device to
                            run very slowly or crash.
                        </p>

            <p>
                DoS attacks are considered a major risk because they can easily interrupt communication and cause
                significant loss of time and money.

                    2.2.3 Distributed DoS
                </h3>

                <p>
                    A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated
                    sources. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled by
                        handler systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more zombies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When ready, the hacker will instruct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out
                        a DDoS attack.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    2.2.4 Botnet
                </h3>

                <p>
                    A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email
                    attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that
                    can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even
                    hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or
                    execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties
                    for nefarious purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many organizations. like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters to identify
                    any botnet locations.

                            is a type of attack used to take control over a user’s
                            mobile device. When infected, the mobile device is instructed to exfiltrate user-sensitive
                            information and send it to the attackers. ZeuS is one example of a malware package with

                    2.2.6 SEO Poisoning
                </h3>

                <p>
                    You’ve probably heard of search engine optimization or SEO which, in simple terms, is about
                    improving an organization’s website so that it gains greater visibility in search engine results.
                </p>

                        So what do you think SEO poisoning might be?

                        <p>
                            Search engines such as Google work by presenting a list of web pages to users based on their
                            search query. These web pages are ranked according to the relevancy of their content.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While many legitimate companies specialize in optimizing websites to better position them,
                            attackers take advantage of popular search terms and use SEO to push malicious sites higher
                            up the ranks of search results. This technique is called SEO poisoning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most common goal of SEO poisoning is to increase traffic to malicious sites that may
                            host malware or attempt social engineering. </p>

                    They explain that they can’t seem to connect to the public Wi-Fi on their phone and ask if you have

                    Hackers have other techniques up their sleeves. Some use brute-force attacks, testing possible
                    password combinations to try and guess a password. Others are able to identify unencrypted passwords
                    by listening in and capturing packets sent on the network. This is called network sniffing. If the
                    password is encrypted, they may still be able to reveal it using a password cracking tool.

                <p>
                    Entering a username and password is one of the most popular forms of authenticating to a web site.

                                This technique attempts to gain access to a system by ‘spraying’ a few commonly used
                                passwords across a large number of accounts. For example, a cybercriminal uses
                                'Password123' with many usernames before trying again with a second commonly-used
                                password, such as ‘qwerty‘.

                                Passwords in a computer system are not stored as plain text, but as hashed values
                                (numerical values that uniquely identify data). A rainbow table is a large dictionary of
                                precomputed hashes and the passwords from which they were calculated.
                            </p>

                                Unlike a brute-force attack that has to calculate each hash, a rainbow attack compares
                                the hash of a password with those stored in the rainbow table. When an attacker finds a
                                match, they identify the password used to create the hash.

                    2.2.10 Advanced Persistent Threats
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent threats (APTs) — a multi-phase, long
                    term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specific target. For these reasons, an individual
                    attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the complexity and the skill level required to carry out such an attack, an APT is usually
                    well-funded and typically targets organizations or nations for business or political reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its main purpose is to deploy customized malware on one or more of the target’s systems and remain
                    there undetected.

                <p>
                    Phew! That’s a lot to take in and hackers certainly have a lot of tools at their disposal. It is
                    important that you know what these are so that you can protect yourself and @Apollo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You think back to some of the suspicious activities that you’ve seen recently in the organization.
                    Based on what you have learned in this topic, what type of attack could each of these scenarios be?
                    Take your time with this one. You have a chance to earn some much-needed defender points.
