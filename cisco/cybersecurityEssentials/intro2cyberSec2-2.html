                    2.2.1 Social Engineering
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Social engineering is the manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential
                    information. Social engineers often rely on people’s willingness to be helpful, but they also prey
                    on their weaknesses. For example, an attacker will call an authorized employee with an urgent
                    problem that requires immediate network access and appeal to the employee’s vanity or greed or
                    invoke authority by using name-dropping techniques in order to gain this access.

                    2.2.2 Denial-of-Service
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are a type of network attack that is relatively simple to carry out,
                    even by an unskilled attacker. A DoS attack results in some sort of interruption of network service
                    to users, devices or applications.
                </p>
            </article>

            <img src="intro2cybersec.img/guru.png" alt="" title="" width="auto" height="auto" />

            <p>
                DoS attacks are considered a major risk because they can easily interrupt communication and cause
                significant loss of time and money.

                    2.2.3 Distributed DoS
                </h3>

                <p>
                    A Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack is similar to a DoS attack but originates from multiple, coordinated
                    sources. For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An attacker builds a network (botnet) of infected hosts called zombies, which are controlled by
                        handler systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The zombie computers will constantly scan and infect more hosts, creating more and more zombies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When ready, the hacker will instruct the handler systems to make the botnet of zombies carry out
                        a DDoS attack.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    2.2.4 Botnet
                </h3>

                <p>
                    A bot computer is typically infected by visiting an unsafe website or opening an infected email
                    attachment or infected media file. A botnet is a group of bots, connected through the Internet, that
                    can be controlled by a malicious individual or group. It can have tens of thousands, or even
                    hundreds of thousands, of bots that are typically controlled through a command and control server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These bots can be activated to distribute malware, launch DDoS attacks, distribute spam email, or
                    execute brute-force password attacks. Cybercriminals will often rent out botnets to third parties
                    for nefarious purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many organizations. like Cisco, force network activities through botnet traffic filters to identify
                    any botnet locations.

                <p>
                    On-path attackers intercept or modify communications between two devices, such as a web browser and
                    a web server, either to collect information from or to impersonate one of the devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This type of attack is also referred to as a man-in-the-middle or man-in-the-mobile attack.

                <p>
                    You’ve probably heard of search engine optimization or SEO which, in simple terms, is about
                    improving an organization’s website so that it gains greater visibility in search engine results.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    You’re enjoying your lunch in the canteen when a colleague approaches you. They seem distressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They explain that they can’t seem to connect to the public Wi-Fi on their phone and ask if you have
                    the private Wi-Fi password to hand so that they can check that their phone is working.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How would you respond?
                </p>


                <p>
                    This colleague could be carrying out a social engineering attack, manipulating you to provide the
                    password used to protect the organization’s private wireless network. You can never be too careful –
                    and, for answering correctly, you’ve earned some defender points. Well done!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hackers have other techniques up their sleeves. Some use brute-force attacks, testing possible
                    password combinations to try and guess a password. Others are able to identify unencrypted passwords
                    by listening in and capturing packets sent on the network. This is called network sniffing. If the
                    password is encrypted, they may still be able to reveal it using a password cracking tool.

                <p>
                    Entering a username and password is one of the most popular forms of authenticating to a web site.
                    Therefore, uncovering your password is an easy way for cybercriminals to gain access to your most

                    2.2.10 Advanced Persistent Threats
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Attackers also achieve infiltration through advanced persistent threats (APTs) — a multi-phase, long
                    term, stealthy and advanced operation against a specific target. For these reasons, an individual
                    attacker often lacks the skill set, resources or persistence to perform APTs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the complexity and the skill level required to carry out such an attack, an APT is usually
                    well-funded and typically targets organizations or nations for business or political reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its main purpose is to deploy customized malware on one or more of the target’s systems and remain
                    there undetected.
