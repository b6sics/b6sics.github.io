                        A computer screen shows a social media website with a picture of a beach and a ‘post’ button.
                        The words ‘Finally on holidays!!!’ are typed as a caption above the picture.

                        The camera zooms out to show the whole computer. A loading progress line connects the computer
                        to a Word Wide Web icon and then connects to a hooded character sitting in front of a laptop
                        with a ‘skull and crossbones’ symbol on it.

                <p>
                    Photos showing bank details or valuable goods and vacation information always put you at risk,
                    and especially when you’ve previously given clues about where you live, or where you are going to
                    visit. Always stop and think about what you are about to post — would you tell it to a complete
                    stranger?!

                        A computer screen appears and shows different login screens. A hidden password is typed into
                        each login box.

                    <p><b>Narrator:</b></p>
                    <p>
                        For each online service you use, you should use a unique secure password.

                    <p><b>Describer:</b></p>
                    <p>
                        Mouse cursor clicks the ‘Log in’ button on the @Apollo login screen. The hidden password turns
                        red and an error message appears saying ‘Looks like these are not your correct details. Please
                        try again’.

                    <p>
                        Memorizing many passwords can become challenging but writing them down would be a security
                        nightmare if someone got access to them.

                    <p>
                        The camera zooms in to the @Apollo login screen, which resets and a ‘Password Manager’ dialogue
                        box appears next to a padlock icon in the top-right of the computer screen.

                    <p>
                        Mouse cursor clicks on an arrow symbol next to the word @Apollo in the ‘Password Manager’
                        dialogue box. Username and password information are then seen populating in the login fields.

                    <p>
                        Password manager applications can protect passwords by saving them in a secure encrypted form.
                        They enable random passwords to be generated and managed easily, averting the need for users to
                        have the same password for multiple accounts, which presents a security risk.

                    The Sales Manager can use the VPN connection on her laptop to create a secure, encrypted channel

                        application is really expensive, and it’s only needed for one small piece of a one-off project.
                        The Design Manager says this would not be a cost-effective purchase and says to install an
                        alternative free application instead — the manager doesn’t mind if it’s from an untrusted source
                        as they feels the risks are low. Should the designer take the manager’s advice?

                    Clicking anything other than the close icon could put your system at risk.

                <p>
                    To be sure, you should run a system security scan with your trusted antivirus software on your
                    computer. And you should always refuse or cancel update reminders unless you are sure they are from
                    the official, trusted source.

                        Camera zooms across an office environment to an employee sitting at a computer. A ‘You have a

                        It is written in broken English and requests that you click a link to re-activate your account.

                        The mouse-cursor highlights the email address: From: itdepartment <team@yourorganization.com>

                        It sounds pretty suspicious. If the link URL is outside of your organization’s domain, it is
                        most probably a phishing email — delete it.

                        IT department to make sure they really did send this email.

                <p>
                    The key indications of a potential phishing email are signs that it has been sent from outside of
                    the organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that even if you think the email is safe, you should always check with your IT department
                    before clicking links to download anything.
