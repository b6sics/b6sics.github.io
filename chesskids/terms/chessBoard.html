                <a id="what-is-chessboard"></a>What Is A Chessboard?
            </h2>
            <p>The <strong>chessboard</strong> is the place where you put all the pieces to play a game of chess. It
                is divided into 64 equal squares of alternating colors: the dark-squares and the light-squares.</p>

                <a id="parts-chessboard"></a>What Are The Parts Of A Chessboard?
            </h2>
            <p>Did you know that, just like you, a chessboard has different parts of the body? Different than you,
                though, it does not have arms and legs. Instead, it has <strong>ranks</strong> and
                <strong>files</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>The <strong>files</strong> are the vertical squares of the chessboard—the ones that go up and down.
            </p>

                <figcaption class="figcaption">The files of the chessboard.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>A chessboard has eight different files, and each has its own name (just like your friends). They are
                named from left to right, and you can call them the <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>,
                <strong>c</strong>, <strong>d</strong>, <strong>e</strong>, <strong>f</strong>, <strong>g</strong>,
                and
                <strong>h</strong>-files.
            </p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/03_9f2aa.gif"
                    alt="The names of the files of a chessboard."></p>
            <p>The <strong>ranks</strong> are the horizontal squares of the chessboard—they go left and right.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/04_ea296.png"
                    alt="The ranks of the chessboard." width="549" height="582"></p>
            <p>Just like the files, they also have names. They are named them from the bottom up:
                <strong>first</strong>, <strong>second</strong>, <strong>third</strong>, <strong>fourth</strong>,
                <strong>fifth</strong>, <strong>sixth</strong>, <strong>seventh</strong>, and
                <strong>eighth</strong>-ranks.
            </p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/05_c83c4.gif"
                    alt="The names of the ranks of a chessboard."></p>
            <p>Now that you know the names of the files and ranks, it is easy to learn what each square is called.
                But don't worry, you will not have to memorize 64 different names. There is a simple trick to find
                out what to call each square.</p>
            <p>Each square has a first and a last name. The first name is the same as the one from the file where
                the square is. The square's last name is the same as its rank.</p>
            <p>Isn't it easy to guess the name of the red square in the picture below?</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/06_f9d21.png"
                    alt="The e4-square of the chessboard." width="500" height="500"></p>
            <p>First name <strong>e</strong>, last name <strong>4</strong>. And we end up with <strong>e4</strong>!

            <h2>
                <a id="set-up"></a>How Do You Set Up A Chessboard?
            </h2>
            <p>Now that you know everything about the chessboard, it is time to learn how to set it up so you can
                start having fun with it. Before we start, you need to learn one important rule: the square on the
                bottom-right corner must be a light-square.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/07_Prancheta 1_e55e9.png"
                    alt="The h1-square must be a light-square." width="500" height="500"></p>
            <p>After making sure your board is facing the right way, we start with the pawns. They always go in
                front of the other pieces.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/08_c7506.png"
                    alt="The pawns on a chessboard." width="500" height="500"></p>
            <p>Now, you should place the rooks on each corner of the board.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/09_a79f8.png"
                    alt="The rooks on a chessboard." width="500" height="500">Then, you place the knights
                right next to the rooks.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/10_06c47.png"
                    alt="The knights on a chessboard." width="500" height="500"></p>
            <p>After that, it is time to place the bishops on the board.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/11_6854d.png"
                    alt="The bishops on a chessboard." width="500" height="500"></p>
            <p>Then, it is time for you to place the queen and the king. The queen always goes first and lands on
                the color that matches her own color.</p>
            <p>An easy way to remember this is to keep in mind that the queen's shoes must match her dress. If the
                queen is wearing a dark dress, she must wear dark shoes. If she's wearing a light dress, she must
                wear light shoes.
            </p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/12_275b4.png"
                    alt="The queens on a chessboard." width="500" height="500"></p>
            <p>After the queen, you can place your king on the remaining square, right next to the queen.</p>
            <p><img style="display: block; margin: 1em auto; width: 75vmin; height: 75vmin;"
                    src="https://media.chesskidfiles.com/images/user/tiny_mce/PedroPinhata/13_032d4.png"
