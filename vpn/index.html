			OpenVPN is a Virtual Private Networking (VPN) solution provided in the Ubuntu Repositories.
			It is flexible, reliable and secure.
			It belongs to the family of SSL/TLS VPN stacks (different from IPSec VPNs).
			This chapter will cover installing and configuring OpenVPN to create a VPN.

				If you want more than just pre-shared keys OpenVPN makes it easy
				to set up a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to use SSL/TLS certificates
				for authentication and key exchange between the VPN server and clients.
				OpenVPN can be used in a routed or bridged VPN mode
				and can be configured to use either UDP or TCP.
				The port number can be configured as well,
				but port 1194 is the official one;
				this single port is used for all communication.
				VPN client implementations are available for almost anything
				including all Linux distributions, OS X, Windows and OpenWRT based WLAN routers.

					<h3>
						Public Key Infrastructure Setup
					</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					The first step in building an OpenVPN configuration
					is to establish a PKI (public key infrastructure).
					The PKI consists of:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						a separate certificate (also known as a public key)
						and private key for the server and each client.
					</li>
					<li>
						a master Certificate Authority (CA) certificate and key,
						used to sign the server and client certificates.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					OpenVPN supports bidirectional authentication based on certificates,
					meaning that the client must authenticate the server certificate
					and the server must authenticate the client certificate
					before mutual trust is established.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both server and client will authenticate the other by first
					verifying that the presented certificate was signed
					by the master certificate authority (CA),
					and then by testing information in the now-authenticated certificate header,
					such as the certificate common name or certificate type (client or server).
				</p>

						<h3>
							Certificate Authority Setup
						</h3>
					</header>

					<p>
						To setup your own Certificate Authority (CA) and generate certificates
						and keys for an OpenVPN server and multiple clients
						first copy the easy-rsa directory to /etc/openvpn.
						This will ensure that any changes to the scripts
						will not be lost when the package is updated.
						From a terminal, run:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							$ sudo make-cadir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
						</code>
					</p>

					<p>
						As root user (run: $ <code>sudo -i</code>) change
						to the newly created directory /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa and run:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							# ./easyrsa init-pki
						</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							# ./easyrsa build-ca
						</code>
					</p>
				</article>

						<h3>
							Server Keys and Certificates
						</h3>
					</header>

					<p>
						Next, we will generate a key pair for the server:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							# ./easyrsa gen-req myservername nopass
						</code>
					</p>

					<p>
						Diffie Hellman parameters must be generated for the OpenVPN server.
						The following will place them in pki/dh.pem:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							# ./easyrsa gen-dh
						</code>
					</p>

					<p>
						And finally a certificate for the server:
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							# ./easyrsa gen-req myservername nopass
						</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>
							# ./easyrsa sign-req server myservername
						</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						All certificates and keys have been generated in subdirectories.
						Common practice is to copy them to /etc/openvpn/:
